# NeetCode Solutions 

Welcome to my NeetCode Solutions repository!  
This is where I dust off my rusty algorithm skills, re-learn the classics, and try not to confuse `O(n)` with `O(n^2)` (again).

## Why Does This Repo Exist?

- To re-familiarize myself with the basics of algorithms and data structures
- To practice solving problems… without the pressure of a technical interview
- To get better at using Git (and maybe even writing commit messages that make sense)
- Because who doesn’t love a good coding challenge?

## What Will You Find Here?

- My solutions to NeetCode problems (sometimes elegant, sometimes over-engineered, always honest)
- Occasional comments and rants about why a problem made me question my life choices
- Code in whatever language I’m feeling brave enough to use that day. But let's not kid ourselves most of it will be in Java.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are for learning and fun.  
If you find a bug, feel free to open an issue or submit a PR—bonus points for dad jokes in your comments.

Happy coding!
