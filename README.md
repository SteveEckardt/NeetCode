# NeetCode Solutions – Because LeetCode Was Too Mainstream 😎

Welcome to my NeetCode Solutions repository!  
This is where I dust off my rusty algorithm skills, re-learn the classics, and try not to confuse `O(n)` with `O(n^2)` (again).

## Why Does This Repo Exist?

- To re-familiarize myself with the basics of algorithms and data structures
- To practice solving problems… without the pressure of a technical interview
- To get better at using Git (and maybe even writing commit messages that make sense)
- Because who doesn’t love a good coding challenge?

## What Will You Find Here?

- My solutions to NeetCode problems (sometimes elegant, sometimes over-engineered, always honest)
- Occasional comments and rants about why a problem made me question my life choices
- Code in whatever language I’m feeling brave enough to use that day (Python, JavaScript, maybe even C++ if I’m feeling nostalgic)

## How to Use This Repo

1. Browse the folders by topic (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, etc.)
2. Marvel at my attempts to write clean code
3. Laugh at the occasional “TODO: Make this less ugly” comment
4. Steal, fork, or contribute if you’d like!

## Disclaimer

These solutions are for learning and fun.  
If you find a bug, feel free to open an issue or submit a PR—bonus points for dad jokes in your comments.

Happy coding! 🚀
